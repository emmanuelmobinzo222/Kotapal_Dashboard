# Storage Explanation

## Current Setup: localStorage (NOT Firebase)

### What We're Using:
- **localStorage** - Browser's built-in storage
- Stored in: Browser's local storage (client-side only)
- Data location: Only on your computer/browser

### Why localStorage?
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No backend needed
- ✅ Fast and simple
- ❌ Data only in one browser
- ❌ Clearing browser data = data loss

## Firebase (Optional)

### If You Want Firebase:
Firebase provides:
- ✅ Cloud database (data stored online)
- ✅ Syncs across devices
- ✅ Persistent data (doesn't get cleared)
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ❌ Requires internet
- ❌ Needs setup/configuration

### Current Status:
- **Signup:** Uses localStorage
- **Login:** Uses localStorage
- **Firebase:** Not currently configured

## Want to Add Firebase?

I can:
1. Connect signup to Firebase
2. Store users in Firebase database
3. Authenticate login through Firebase
4. Sync data across devices

Would you like me to add Firebase support?
