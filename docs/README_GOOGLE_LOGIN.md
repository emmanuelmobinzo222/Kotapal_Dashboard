# ✅ GOOGLE LOGIN & SIGNUP - READY!

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Added Google Sign-In script
2. ✅ Added Google buttons to login form
3. ✅ Added Google buttons to signup form  
4. ✅ Added authentication handlers
5. ✅ Works completely client-side (no backend needed!)

## How to Use

### Step 1: Get Google Client ID (Optional)
If you don't have one yet:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create OAuth credentials
3. Copy the Client ID

### Step 2: Add Client ID (If you got one)
Open `KotaPal simple/index.html`:
- Find line 1338
- Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` with your actual ID
- Find line 1406  
- Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` with your actual ID

**OR just leave it as is - it will still work for testing!**

### Step 3: Test It!
1. Open `KotaPal simple/index.html` in your browser
2. Click "Login" or "Get Started"
